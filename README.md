## Note: This project's releases are compiled against "openjdk version 1.8.0_144" and requires Java 8 to be installed on your computer to work properly. Using Java 9 or higher will result in DPCS getting crashed due to Unhandled exceptions, unless I release a patch please only use Java 8 to run DPCS.

## Issues on devices shipping with Google's Project Treble:
Since I'm not investing anymore of my time on this project, there is a high chance that some of the features may not work on Project Treble enabled devices since they have a few changes in their file system partitioning scheme. The features in DPCS that directly rely on /system partition to work are most likely broken.
